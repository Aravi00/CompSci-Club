# Graph = nodes + edges
# Tree: a graph where every node is connected to every other node

# storing a graph: adjescentsly list 
# adjescentsly list = adj[x] = [a,b,c]
# every node is a list of other nodes that its connected to. 
# adjecently matrix = 2D array with each value is true or false for connected/disconnected.
